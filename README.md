# A Blotto Game Approach to Ride-hailing Markets with Electric Vehicles

**The 22nd IEEE European Control Conference (ECC 2024)**, Stockholm, Sweden, 25-28 June 2024.

**Abstract:** When a centrally operated ride-hailing company
considers to enter a market already served by another company,
it has to make a strategic decision about how to distribute its
fleet among different regions in the area. This decision will
be influenced by the market share the company can secure
and the costs associated with charging the vehicles in each
region, all while competing with the company already operating
in the area. In this paper, we propose a Colonel Blotto-like
game to model this decision-making. For the class of games
that we study, we first prove the existence and uniqueness
of a Nash Equilibrium. Subsequently, we provide its general
characterization and present an algorithm for computing the
ones in the feasible set’s interior. Additionally, for a simplified
scenario involving two regions, which would correspond to a
city area with a downtown and a suburban region, we also
provide a method to check for the equilibria on the feasible
set’s boundary. Finally, through a numerical case study, we
illustrate the impact of charging prices on the position of the
Nash equilibrium.
